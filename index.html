    As an image-maker in such an image-saturated world, I am in a unique position to
    reflect on the very action of image making and also to evaluate in my artwork the
    significance of the photograph as an artistic medium. I want to create photographs
    that reflect my situation as a Millennial who is simultaneously observing, participating
    in and creating the culture around him. I have grown up and matured in a time when social
    networks catalogue every moment of my very growth, and so with my generation I am immersed
    more than anyone before in the ubiquity of the photographic image. With my work I intend to give a
    culturally, racially, politically and historically transcending voice to the artistic ambiguities
    that arise from social networking and information sharing, specifically concerning ideas
    of self-identity in the western world and how the process of shaping the notion of self
    compares with more distant cultures and societies. Expression through personal image speaks
    volumes about an individual, especially an artist, and by deliberately exploring this expression
    through the process of image making, I can begin to reconcile with the complexities of identity
    in the 21st century.

    I am a Kansas City native studying Photography &amp; Imaging at Ringling College of Art &amp; Design
    and currently pursuing a 1 year certificate in the General Studies Program at the International Center of
    Photography. I was previously an editorial photography intern at Mashable in New York City. I am an avid
    runner and unabashed tech gee kwho spends too much time reading 20th century Russian literature and watching
    Vine comiplations.
